# Lazy Results

This library provides lazy versions of [Result objects][RESULT].

Lazy results optimize performance by deferring costly operations until absolutely necessary. They behave like regular
results, but only execute the underlying operation when an actual check for success or failure is performed.


## Adding Lazy Results to Your Build

Artifact coordinates:

- Group ID: `com.leakyabstractions`
- Artifact ID: `result-lazy`
- Version: `{{ site.current_version }}`

[Maven Central Repository][ARTIFACTS] provides snippets for different build tools to declare this dependency.


## Creating Lazy Results

We can use [`LazyResults::ofSupplier`][OF_SUPPLIER] to create a lazy result.

```java
{% include_relative result-lazy/src/test/java/example/Fragments.java fragment="creation" %}
```

While [suppliers][SUPPLIER] can return a fixed success or failure, lazy results shine when they encapsulate
time-consuming or resource-intensive operations.

```java
{% include_relative result-lazy/src/test/java/example/Fragments.java fragment="expensive_calculation" %}
```

This sample method simply increments and returns a counter for brevity. However, in a typical scenario, this would
involve an I/O operation.


## Skipping Expensive Calculations

The advantage of lazy results is that they defer invoking the provided [`Supplier`][SUPPLIER] for as long as possible.
Despite this, you can screen and transform them like any other result without losing their laziness.

```java
{% include_relative result-lazy/src/test/java/example/Example_Test.java test="should_skip_expensive_calculation" %}
```

In this example, the expensive calculation is omitted because the lazy result is never fully evaluated. This test
demonstrates that a lazy result can be transformed while maintaining laziness, ensuring that the expensive calculation
is deferred.

> These methods will preserve laziness:
> 
> - [`Result::filter`][RESULT_FILTER]
> - [`Result::recover`][RESULT_RECOVER]
> - [`Result::mapSuccess`][RESULT_MAP_SUCCESS]
> - [`Result::mapFailure`][RESULT_MAP_FAILURE]
> - [`Result::map`][RESULT_MAP]
> - [`Result::flatMapSuccess`][RESULT_FLAT_MAP_SUCCESS]
> - [`Result::flatMapFailure`][RESULT_FLAT_MAP_FAILURE]
> - [`Result::flatMap`][RESULT_FLAT_MAP]


## Triggering Result Evaluation

Finally, when it's time to check whether the operation succeeds or fails, the lazy result will execute it. This is
triggered by using any of the _terminal_ methods, such as [`Result::hasSuccess`][RESULT_HAS_SUCCESS].

```java
{% include_relative result-lazy/src/test/java/example/Example_Test.java test="should_execute_expensive_calculation" %}
```

Here, the expensive calculation is executed because the lazy result is finally evaluated.

> Terminal methods will immediately evaluate the lazy result:
> 
> - [`Result::hasSuccess`][RESULT_HAS_SUCCESS]
> - [`Result::hasFailure`][RESULT_HAS_FAILURE]
> - [`Result::getSuccess`][RESULT_GET_SUCCESS]
> - [`Result::getFailure`][RESULT_GET_FAILURE]
> - [`Result::orElse`][RESULT_OR_ELSE]
> - [`Result::orElseMap`][RESULT_OR_ELSE_MAP]
> - [`Result::streamSuccess`][RESULT_STREAM_SUCCESS]
> - [`Result::streamFailure`][RESULT_STREAM_FAILURE]


## Handling Success and Failure Eagerly

By default, [`Result::ifSuccess`][RESULT_IF_SUCCESS], [`Result::ifFailure`][RESULT_IF_FAILURE], and
[`Result::ifSuccessOrElse`][RESULT_IF_SUCCESS_OR_ELSE] are treated as terminal methods. This means they eagerly evaluate
the result and then perform an action based on its status.

```java
{% include_relative result-lazy/src/test/java/example/Example_Test.java test="should_handle_success_eagerly" %}
```

In this test, we don't explicitly _unwrap the value_ or _check the status_, but since we want to
_consume the success value_, we need to evaluate the lazy result first.

Furthermore, even if we wanted to handle the failure scenario, we would still need to evaluate the lazy result.

```java
{% include_relative result-lazy/src/test/java/example/Example_Test.java test="should_handle_failure_eagerly" %}
```

In this other test, we use [`Result::ifFailure`][RESULT_IF_FAILURE] instead of [`Result::ifSuccess`][RESULT_IF_SUCCESS].
Since the lazy result is evaluated to a success, the failure consumer is never executed.

> These methods are treated as terminal when used with regular consumer functions:
> 
> - [`Result::ifSuccess`][RESULT_IF_SUCCESS]
> - [`Result::ifFailure`][RESULT_IF_FAILURE]
> - [`Result::ifSuccessOrElse`][RESULT_IF_SUCCESS_OR_ELSE]


## Handling Success and Failure Lazily

When these conditional actions may also be skipped along with the expensive calculation, we can encapsulate them into a
[`LazyConsumer`][LAZY_CONSUMER] instead of a regular [`Consumer`][CONSUMER]. All we need to do is to create the consumer
using [`LazyConsumer::of`][LAZY_CONSUMER_OF]. Lazy consumers will preserve the laziness until a terminal method is
eventually used on the result.

```java
{% include_relative result-lazy/src/test/java/example/Example_Test.java test="should_handle_success_lazily" %}
```

Here, we use a lazy consumer with [`Result::ifSuccess`][RESULT_IF_SUCCESS] so the expensive calculation is skipped
because the lazy result is never fully evaluated.
